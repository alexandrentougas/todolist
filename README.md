# To Do List

[Heroku preview](https://todolist-ntougas-alexandre.herokuapp.com/)

PS : There's a little bug with the preview which consists in the data being displayed base on the original state of the list from when it was deployed. Just manipulate the list once (add/update) to see the actual state of the list. This doen't happen if you clone the repo and test it locally but if you find a solution to this I'd gladly accept it :)
